# Few-shot-learning-based-breast-cancer-detection-using-multi-task-learning
Designed and trained a model to perform multi-tasks at the same time using a handful set of images 

Datasets used:
1) 'ICIAR' for 2 class classification
2) 'BreaKHis' for primary and finegrain classifications

The motivation of the project work is to develop a model which is capable for learning multi tasks at the same instant of time using very few images for training.

The jupyter notebook named "git_mtl2_enetb0_m1_Multitask_Few_shot_Breakhis.ipynb" contains codes for tuning and re-training the previously trained "EfficientB0" on BreaKHis dataset for 2 class (Primary) classification and 8 class (Finegrain) classification.
